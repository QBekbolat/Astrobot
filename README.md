# Astrobot
THIS BOT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. New AstroBot can be found here: https://github.com/RononDex/Astrobot

An advanced discord bot running on .net core, that can help with anything that is astronomy related (platesolving, image analysis, astronomical weather forecast, get information on DSO's, ...)


This is a complete rework of the "/RononDex/DiscordAstroBot" Repository

Uses my self written chat bot framework:
 - [AwesomeChatBot](https://github.com/RononDex/AwesomeChatBot)
 - [AwesomeChatBot.Discord](https://github.com/RononDex/AwesomeChatBot.Discord)
